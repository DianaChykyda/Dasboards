# Project Plan: NASA Objects Report Dashboard 🚀

## 1. Project Description 🗒️

The goal of this project is to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes key metrics related to NASA objects, including potentially hazardous objects. The dashboard will display summaries like average diameter, counts of hazardous and safe objects, as well as detailed visualizations of absolute magnitude and the relationship between estimated diameter and relative velocity.

## 2. Data Collection and Preparation 📁

### 2.1. Data Loading

**Objects Data:** Includes attributes such as name, relative velocity, estimated diameters, absolute magnitude, and hazard status.

## 3. Creating Visualizations 📊

### 3.1. Summary Metrics

Display key metrics such as average diameter, total hazardous objects, and total safe objects in summary cards.

### 3.2. Absolute Magnitude Bar Chart

Create a bar chart showing the sum of absolute magnitude for various objects, categorized by their names.

### 3.3. Estimated Diameter vs. Relative Velocity Scatter Plot

Develop a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between estimated maximum diameter and relative velocity of objects.

## 4. Adding Filters and Slicers 🖋️

### 4.1. Object Name Filter

Implement a filter to allow users to view data specific to selected objects by name.

### 4.2. Hazard Status Filter

Add a slicer to filter objects based on whether they are hazardous or safe.
